### Motivating MESS process-model parameter estimation

Now that we have identified the neutral model as the most probable, we can
estimate parameters of the emipirical data given this model. Essentially,
we are asking the question "What are the parameters of the model that
generate summary statistics most similar to those of the empirical data?"

### Implement ML parameter estimation

Let's start with a new clean Rscript, so create a new file and save it as
"MESS-Regression.R", then load the necessary libraries and simulated data.
#### Load libraries, setwd, and load the simulated data
```R
library(randomForest)
library(caret)
library(reticulate)

setwd("/home/rstudio/MESS-inference")
simdata = MESS$load_local_sims("MESS-SIMOUT.csv")[[1]]
```

#### Extract sumulations generated under the 'filtering' assembly model
Let's pretend that the most probable model from the classification procedure
was 'environmental filtering'. If our goal is to estimate parameters under this
model then we want to _exclude_ simulations from the ml inference that do not
fit our most probable model. This can be achieved by selecting rows in the
`simdata` data.frame that have "filtering" as the `assembly_model`.
```R
simdata = simdata[simdata$assembly_model == "filtering", ]
simdata
```

#### Split train and test data as normal
Again, we'll split the data into training and testing sets.

```R
tmp <- sample(2, nrow(simdata), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.7, 0.3))
train <- simdata[tmp==1,]
test <- simdata[tmp==2,]
```

#### Train the ML regressor as normal
Train the ml model to perform regression, as our focal dependent variable takes
continuous values. The `randomForest` package auto-detects if the dependent
variable is continuous or categorical, so there's nothing more to do there. We
will use the same formula as before, specifying `local_S` and the first Hill
number on each axis of biodiversity as the predictor variables.

```R
rf <- randomForest(colrate ~ local_S + pi_h1 + abund_h1 + trait_h1, data=train, proximity=TRUE)
rf
```

#### Plot results of predictions for colrate of held-out training set
For a regression analysis we can't use a confusion matrix because the response
is continuous, so instead we evaluate prediction accuracy by making a scatter
plot showing predictions as a function of known simulated values. With perfect
prediction accuracy the points in the scatter plot would fall along the identity
line.

```R
preds <- predict(rf, test)
plot(preds, test$colrate)
```

## What can we say about the accuracy of ml prediction of colonization rate?

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## Prediction accuracy should be quantified with a formal method.

What we are doing here is a very qualitative, ad hoc evaluation of prediction
accuracy. This is another case where the full details of performing ml inference
are slightly out of scope for this workshop, given the amount of time we have.
In a real analysis one should more formally quantify this with mean squared
error, or mean absolute error, or pseudo-R^2, some of which are provided in
the `randomForest` package, e.g.:

```R
rf <- randomForest(colrate ~ local_S + pi_h1 + abund_h1 + trait_h1, data=train, proximity=TRUE)
mean(rf$rsq)
```
```default
0.6219401
```

#### Predict `colrate` of test simulation and plot distribution of predictions
Now we can practice making predictions for a _single_ simulation and looking
at uncertainty in the prediction. Like we did before we can select one simulation
by using the `test [#, ]` row selection strategy on our `test` data.frame.

When we ask for `predict.all=TRUE` this will return the prediction value for each
tree in the rf, and we can plot the aggregation of these predictions using `hist`
to show a histogram.

```R
preds <- predict(rf, test[5, ], predict.all=TRUE)
hist(preds[[2]])
```

### Hands-on Exercise: Predicting MESS parameters of mystery simulations
Now see if you can load the mystery simulations and do the regression inference
on one or a couple of them. Try to do this on your own, but if you get stuck
you can check the hint here:

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hints: Loading the mystery sims and making predictions

```R
## Importing the mystery data
mystery_sims = read.csv("/home/rstudio/MESS-inference/Mystery-data.csv")

## Predict for mystery sim 1
myst_sim = 1
mystery_pred = predict(rf, mystery_sims[myst_sim, ])
print(mystery_pred)
```

A link to the key containing the true `colrate` values is hidden below.
Donâ€™t peek until you have a guess for your simulated data! How close did you get?

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## The Key is here

[Assembly models per mystery simulation are in this file](data/Mystery-key.csv)
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## More to explore if you are ahead of the group

If you are ahead of the group you will see that the "key" also contains the
true values of `J` and `ecological_strength` so you might try performing
the regression inference on these as well. Are either of these parameters
harder or easier to estimate than `colrate`? Why do you think that is?

You might also try manipulating the predictor variables before training the
ml model and evaluating the impact on performance. For example, try only using
abundance Hill numbers, or only genetics Hill numbers. Try using *all* the Hill
numbers for all the data axes. How does the composition of the predictor
variables change the ml parameter estimation accuracy?
