# ML parameter estimation with MESS simulations

## Key questions

1. How do I perform a process-inference using RoLE simulations in R?

## Lesson objectives

After this lesson, learners should be able to...

1. Use RoLE simulations and RandomForest ML (w/ tidymodels) to perform inference
1. Interpret results in terms of story
1. Brainstorm applications to real data

## Planned exercises

* ML parameter estimation
* Posterior predictive simulations (if time)
* Free time to experiment with other example datasets

### ML parameter estimation
Now that we have identified the neutral model as the most probable, we can
estimate parameters of the emipirical data given this model. Essentially,
we are asking the question "What are the parameters of the model that
generate summary statistics most similar to those of the empirical data?"

#### Train the ML regressor
#### Plot cross-validation results
#### Perform regression to predict dispersal_prob of empirical data and view results
