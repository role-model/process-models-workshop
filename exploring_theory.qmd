# Using RoLE to explore hypotheses

## Key questions

1. How do I use RoLE to explore/generate theoretical predictions

## Lesson objectives

After this lesson, learners should be able to...

1. Formulate hypotheses for how tweaking parameters will affect model outputs
1. Use RoLE to test these hypotheses in silico
1. Synthesize the outcomes

## Planned exercises

* Group brainstorming of params to tweak
* Breakout to test them
* Come together to debrief/synthesize
