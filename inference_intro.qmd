# Comparing simulations to empirical data

## Key questions

1. What kinds of empirical data can we leverage using process modeling?
1. How can we infer process from empirical data using simulation models?
1. What are the challenges associated with this and how do we escape them?

## Lesson objectives

After this lesson, learners should be able to...

1. Articulate ways in which empirical data could be elucdiated using sim models
1. Describe the conceptual framework for going data-to-process
1. Describe the many-to-one/model identifiability problems and how to break them

## Planned exercises


## Supporting materials

_Describe, and where possible link to, lesson materials that will be needed for this section of the workshop. These could include code for live coding, code documentation, book chapters, videos/animations, etc._

_For bonus points organize these according to whether they already exist or we need to create them!_

### Extant

### To create

* Relevant chapters of user guide.

## Key points

_List 1-3 key takeaways from this section of the workshop._
