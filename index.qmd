# Introduction

This is a quarto book project for creating materials for the second half of the MDBD workshop.

There is a list of planned sections in the "List of sections" chapter.

To add a new section, start from the "Template section". Open `template_section.qmd`, save-as, and populate it; then add it to the list of sections in `_quarto.yml`.

To update the Pages site, run `quarto render` from a local terminal. This will render the files to the `docs` directory. Then push, and GitHub pages will serve the site from `docs`.
