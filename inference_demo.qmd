# Machine learning inference with RoLE simulations

## Key questions

1. How do I perform a process-inference using RoLE simulations in R?

## Lesson objectives

After this lesson, learners should be able to...

1. Use RoLE simulations, caret/parsnip/???, and (simulated?) data to do the ML inference
1. Interpret results in terms of story
1. Brainstorm applications to real data

## Planned exercises


## Supporting materials

_Describe, and where possible link to, lesson materials that will be needed for this section of the workshop. These could include code for live coding, code documentation, book chapters, videos/animations, etc._

_For bonus points organize these according to whether they already exist or we need to create them!_

### Extant

### To create
