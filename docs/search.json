    "text": "2.3 Lesson outline\n\n2.3.1 (Lecture + discussion) What do we mean by process modeling, anyway?\nKey points:\n\nIn a process model, we play a “game”, with a set of entities following a system of defined rules, and see how the outcomes of the game vary as we change the rules.\nThese models are often nondeterministic and often do not have closed-form, analytical solutions.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 (Lecture + discussion) What are the applications of process modeling for eco-evo?\nKey points:\n\nA process model offers almost unlimited flexibility for modeling complex, interacting processes.\nEverything depends on the rules we define! So it is very important to understand the rules of the game we are playing.\n\nDiscussion/brainstorm:\n\nWhat are some possible applications of process modeling in your area of interest?\n\n\n\n2.3.3 (Lecture + discussion) What are the constraints we encounter in a process modeling approach?\nKey points:\n\nProcess models are computationally expensive! Modern computing strategies help, but high dimensionality is a serious constraint.\nIssues like model identifiability and correlation != causation. Just because our mechanism produces results that match some data, doesn’t necessarily mean our mechanism is the same mechanism that produced that data.\nProcess models are themselves nondeterministic, so must be run many times.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 (Example) The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity\nKey points:\n\nHubbell’s UNTB is a process model. Simply put, it is a game played with a set of simple rules, with emergent properties that we find interesting.\nFor the rest of today, we’ll be using UNTB as an example process model.\n\n\n\n2.3.5 (Lecture + game of chance) Playing neutral theory\nKey points:\n\nThe rules of neutral theory\nWe can play neutral theory manually. However, computers would make it considerably faster!"

The three models are neutral, in which all individuals are ecologically equivalent; competition, in which species have traits, and differential survival probability is weighted by distance of traits from the trait mean in the local community (closer to the trait mean == higher probability of death); and filtering, in which there is an environmental optimum, and proximity of trait values to this optimum is positively correlated with survival probability.\nBasically we want to know, are individuals in the local community ecologically equivalent, and if not are they interacting more with each other or more with the local environment.\n\n8.3.2.1 Train the ML classifier\n\n\n8.3.2.2 Plot confusion matrix\n\n\n8.3.2.3 Perform classification of empirical data and view results\n\n\n\n8.3.3 ML parameter estimation\nNow that we have identified the neutral model as the most probable, we can estimate parameters of the emipirical data given this model.

We will set parameter ranges for these, and each simulation will sample a random value from this range. In a new cell use the we’ll create some new roleParams objects to reflect neutral, competition, and environmental filtering assembly models.\np_neutral <- roleParams()\np_comp <- roleParams()\np_filt <- roleParams()\n\n\n9.3.1.2 Run the role experiment encapsulating these different models\nNow we can run a bunch of simulations given our new parameterization using the runRole() method. runRole takes one argument (nsims) which indicates the number of independent community assembly realizations to perform.\nexp <- roleExperiment(list(p_neutral, p_comp, p_filt))\nexp <- runRole(exp)\n\n\n9.3.1.3 Download the pre-baked simulations\nSince it can take quite some time to run a number of simulations sufficient for model selection and parameter estimation we will use a suite of pre-baked simulations generated ahead of time. Go to the terminal tab in Rstudio and fetch them with wget from the workshop site:\n\\# FIXME\n# Make sure you're in the role-workshop directory\ncd ~/role-workshop\nwget https://compphylo.github.io/Oslo2019/MESS_files/MESS_simulations/SIMOUT.txt\nwc -l SIMOUT.txt\n100%[======================================>] 14,234,338  50.0M/s   in 0.3s\n2019-08-11 01:25:27 (50.0 MB/s) - \"SIMOUT.txt.1\" saved [14234338/14234338]\n24440 SIMOUT.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe wc command counts the number of lines if you pass it the -l flag. You can see this series of ~25k simulations is about 14MB.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2 ML assembly model classification\nThe first step is now to assess the model of community assembly that best fits the data. The three models are neutral, in which all individuals are ecologically equivalent; competition, in which species have traits, and differential survival probability is weighted by distance of traits from the trait mean in the local community (closer to the trait mean == higher probability of death); and filtering, in which there is an environmental optimum, and proximity of trait values to this optimum is positively correlated with survival probability.\nBasically we want to know, are individuals in the local community ecologically equivalent, and if not are they interacting more with each other or more with the local environment.\n\n9.3.2.1 Train the ML classifier\n\n\n9.3.2.2 Plot confusion matrix\n\n\n9.3.2.3 Perform classification of empirical data and view results\n\n\n\n9.3.3 ML parameter estimation\nNow that we have identified the neutral model as the most probable, we can estimate parameters of the emipirical data given this model. Essentially, we are asking the question “What are the parameters of the model that generate summary statistics most similar to those of the empirical data?”\n\n9.3.3.1 Train the ML regressor\n\n\n9.3.3.2 Plot cross-validation results\n\n\n9.3.3.3 Perform regression to predict dispersal_prob of empirical data and view results"
