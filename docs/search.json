    "text": "2.3 Lesson outline\n\n2.3.1 (Lecture + discussion) What do we mean by process modeling, anyway?\nKey points:\n\nIn a process model, we play a “game”, with a set of entities following a system of defined rules, and see how the outcomes of the game vary as we change the rules.\nThese models are often nondeterministic and often do not have closed-form, analytical solutions.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 (Lecture + discussion) What are the applications of process modeling for eco-evo?\nKey points:\n\nA process model offers almost unlimited flexibility for modeling complex, interacting processes.\nEverything depends on the rules we define! So it is very important to understand the rules of the game we are playing.\n\nDiscussion/brainstorm:\n\nWhat are some possible applications of process modeling in your area of interest?\n\n\n\n2.3.3 (Lecture + discussion) What are the constraints we encounter in a process modeling approach?\nKey points:\n\nProcess models are computationally expensive! Modern computing strategies help, but high dimensionality is a serious constraint.\nIssues like model identifiability and correlation != causation. Just because our mechanism produces results that match some data, doesn’t necessarily mean our mechanism is the same mechanism that produced that data.\nProcess models are themselves nondeterministic, so must be run many times.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 (Example) The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity\nKey points:\n\nHubbell’s UNTB is a process model. Simply put, it is a game played with a set of simple rules, with emergent properties that we find interesting.\nFor the rest of today, we’ll be using UNTB as an example process model.\n\n\n\n2.3.5 (Lecture + game of chance) Playing neutral theory\nKey points:\n\nThe rules of neutral theory\nWe can play neutral theory manually. However, computers would make it considerably faster!"

We could compare the observed data (e.g. Hill numbers) to a process model to see which outcomes are (in)consistent.\nConsistent is not the same as confirming!\nAs a starting point, we can see if we can recover generative parameters when we know how they were produced.\n\n\n\n5.3.2 (Lecture/discussion) Random forest regression\nKey points:\n\nTo guess at the parameters that generated some outcome data, we’re writing a model of the general form parameter ~ results. This isn’t necessarily a linear or otherwise tidy relationship, so we’ll use machine learning.\nRandom forest can do regression with many parameters predicting nonlinear relationships.\nWe will begin by using a random forest to try to recover parameter values for known sims.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 (Coding exercise) Fitting a random forest to our neutral data\n\n\n5.3.4 (Discussion) What problems arise in the random forest?\nKey points:\n\nMultiple sets of parameters can lead to the same outcomes, making it difficult to infer backwards.\n\n\n\n5.3.5 (Discussion) How might we address these challenges?\nKey points:\n\nMore data dimensions can break a many-to-one mapping.\nLeaves unanswered, or assumes/works conditional on UNTB being the correct underlying game"
